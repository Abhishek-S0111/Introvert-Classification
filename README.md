# 🧠 Introvert Classification – Are You a Ghost or a Party Animal?

Welcome to the most unnecessarily accurate model you've ever seen — one that tries to decide whether you're an **introvert** or **extrovert** based on a few simple questions.

We used machine learning (because obviously) and wrapped it up in a clean Streamlit app so you can get judged in real-time.

## 🔍 What It Does

You answer a short set of personality-related questions, and our model tells you:

> "Yep, you're a certified introvert."  
> or  
> "You probably talk to strangers at bus stops."

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python  
- 🤖 Scikit-learn and XGBoost (model building)  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy (data wrangling)  
- 🎯 Streamlit (app deployment)  
- 🎨 Sarcasm (a constant throughout)
